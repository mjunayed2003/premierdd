  - `thread:join`
  - `thread:leave`
  - `message:typing`
  - `message:read`

## Behavior Notes

- `super_admin` can only send messages in support threads.
- `worker` can only start chats with `manager`.
- `worker` can reply to an existing admin-created chat, but cannot initiate a new one with `admin`.
- `block/unblock` rules:
  - `admin` can block/unblock `manager` and `worker`.
  - `manager` can block/unblock `worker`.
- Notifications are sent to unread thread participants after each message.

## Search Rules

- Search results for contacts follow role and project scope rules.
- `worker` contact search shows only `manager`.
- `worker` chat threads can still show an existing `admin` conversation if it was started by `admin` earlier.
- `super_admin` is excluded from regular direct chat search results.
